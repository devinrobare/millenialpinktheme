Months ago, I saw an instagram post advertising a Glossier sale.
The post itself was a screenshot of some JavaScript, written to outline the details for the sale.
(And it was 20% off, so you bet I did some shopping!)

One of the top comments was "I need a glossier vscode theme"
And I agreed. So I made one!

I used the original instagram post, product images from the website, and an article about solarized themes (easier readability while being less tiring to your eyes) to source the colors. The end result is a VSCode theme that looks like a slice of birthday cake.

I made sure it looks cute in Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, and HTML and CSS

I hope you enjoy, and I would love to hear feedback!

**I am in no way affiliated with Glossier, I just love their products and aesthetic and was inspiried by their instagram post. Plus I'm tired of dark mode, I wanted pink mode!
