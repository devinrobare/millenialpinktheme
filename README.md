Months ago, I saw an instagram post advertising a Glossier sale.
The post itself was a screenshot of some JavaScript, written to outline the details for the sale.
(And it was 20% off, so you bet I did some shopping!)

One of the top comments was "I need a glossier vscode theme"
And I agreed. So I made one!

I used the original instagram post, product images from the website, and an article about solarized themes (easier readability while being less tiring to your eyes) to design a VSCode theme that looks like a slice of birthday cake. (Balm dot com, that is.)

**I am in no way affiliated with Glossier, I just love their products and aesthetic and was inspiried by their instagram post. Plus I'm tired of dark mode, I wanted pink mode!
