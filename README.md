# Pink Mode is the new Dark Mode
Inspired by a post on the make up brand Gl*ssier's instagram, I pulled colors from product images on their website. Taking into account that it needed to be functional too, I also referenced solarized themes to carefully choose a color palette. The end result? A soft pink theme that's easy to read and reminds me of a slice of birthday cake. My red-green colorblind husband even gave it the stamp of approval!
